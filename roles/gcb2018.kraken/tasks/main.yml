################ TASK 2 ######################################
# This file contains a list of task for this role.

# For installing kraken, we need to do multiple tasks:
#   - Install essential packages for compiling source code.
#   - Clone the Kraken source code repository from github
#   - Build Kraken


# Very helpful for this task is the ansible index, which lists all ansible modules with examples:
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html



# For this module you should check out the apt module.
# In these 3 Tasks we want to install the apt packages called "build-essential", "make" and "libgomp1"
- name: Install build-essential for getting all the good compiling tools
  apt:

- name: Install make, which actually compiles everything for us
  apt:

- name: Install libgomp1, which is a needed library for kraken
  apt:


# Now we want to get the source code for kraken from github.
# For this, ansible provides the git module.
# The repo is located at https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken.git
# We want to save the source code in /home/ubuntu/kraken_src/
- name: Clone kraken repo to home
  git:



# After that has been finished, we finally want to install kraken..
# For this we execute the provided shell script by kraken.
# The shell module simply takes a shell command like you would type it in in your bash terminal.
# The additional args field gives various options:
#   - chdir changes the current directory to the specified path
#   - creates implies, that ansible should not execute this task, when the specified file already exists (idempotence)
- name: Install kraken to /usr/local/bin
  shell: "sh install_kraken.sh /usr/local/bin/"
  args:
    chdir: "/home/ubuntu/kraken_src/"
    creates: "/usr/local/bin/kraken"
